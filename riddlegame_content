      "You can only carry up to four items on your person while travelling through the map. Some of these items are required to pull off the pranks, while others, such as color-coordinated keys and crowbars, are used primarily to get past locked doors or windows. Miss T has position is displayed on the upper-left corner of the screen, though the movement of the camera can make it hard to determine her exact location. You have the option of disabling this camera for an added challenge. Aside from tools, you can find Stars that can be exchanged for hints regarding your current objective, and you can watch an ad to get a free star each play-through. Completing a prank rewards coins which can be used to purchase tools during a play-through, in case you have a hard time getting a necessary item"

      "Mr. Riddle spots you, she will give chase, with the music changing to signal this. Despite her age, she can follow you through windows provided they are not too high off the ground. Should she catch you, you can either take the loss or watch an ad to get another shot, with Miss T being moved to a far-off point in the map while you remain where you are. Luckily, you can jump over obstacles as a means of outmaneuvering your teacher, and your rewards suffer no penalty for being spotted. Scary Teacher 3D also has an energy system that limits how many times you can play before letting your energy recharge; this also doubles as your health. You take it; by falling from high drops or walking onto bear traps that are placed underneath windows or in front of doors. You can disable these traps by picking them up, though your teacher will not set them off even if you place them somewhere else. Be careful when disposing them as they can damage you if they land too closely"

      "You can pull 14 pranks in Miss T;s house and for ease of reading, these will be split into two groups of seven pranks each; you have to complete the pranks in order to unlock them. Sometimes, Miss T;s house will have randomly-selected windows boarded up randomly-selected doors locked up, so be prepared to find keys or crowbars if your normal path is inaccessible. Miss T;s house also has a couple of moveable ladders you can use to access the second floor without using the stairs. Luckily, Miss T will never use these ladders. Your first prank doubles as the tutorial for Scary Teacher 3D, and it involves hiding a mousetrap in Miss T;s coffee table. Follow the directions and you should get through this prank with ease. The mousetrap is located in a wardrobe close to the front door, and once you put the mousetrap in place, you will have to hide it by placing a nearby magazine over it. This prank is not that difficult to complete"

      "Your second prank has you ruin Miss T;s morning cereal and at this point you are on your own. The game introduces gadgets you can use to turn the tide, ranging from energy refills to traps that stun Miss T. To equip a gadget, select it and watch an ad, and you can activate your gadget by pressing a button to the left of your inventory Miss T eats her breakfast at the kitchen, which is located at the far end of her house. Head on over there via the yard and avoid being spotted from the windows. Once you have reached the backyard, which comes with both a sauna and a swimming pool, look for the backdoor which leads directly to the kitchen. If you are feeling bold, you can sneak in via the windows by climbing onto the basement door to the right of the house and walking through the bushes, opening a window to get inside"

      "Once you are in the kitchen, there are various condiments you can use Miss T;s cereal. It might be tempting to use the ketchup or the hot sauce, but these will leave obvious red blotches and fail the prank in the process. Instead, go for the salt shaker conveniently located on the kitchen table. You can also opt to use the unidentifiable white bottle on one of the kitchen counters. Regardless of your choice, Miss T will return to the kitchen as soon as you sabotage her meal so get out as soon as possible. Your objective here is to break Miss T;s television so she cannot watch her favorite TV show, a rather excessive; but it must be done. Her television is located in a room to the right of the front door, and you will need a heavy tool of sorts, such as a crowbar or a hammer, to bust her television. There are two places where you can find the necessary tool"

Be careful, as the entrance might have a bear trap or two and Miss T will periodically enter the basement via a nearby staircase. The second location is a shed to the left of the house, where you will find a crowbar and a hammer, among other tools. Miss T almost never patrols this area. Regardless of your choice, you can enter the TV room via a window leading to the porch. Drop in, smash the TV and get out of there before your teacher spots you"

You will need something to cut her dress to pieces, and here are some suggestions: There should be a pair of scissors in the shed outside, or Close to Miss T;s bedroom is a workshop full of statues, where you will find a box cutter on one of the shelves. You can avoid having to take the stairs by using the ladder just outside the house, which leads to a gym in the corner opposite her bedroom. Once you get inside, search her wardrobe for the dress and destroy it. If you have the energy to spare, you can jump out the window. Miss T will head back to her room once a dress has been destroyed, even if it is the wrong one"

Pick up the key and unlock the cabinet, but be ready to move as Miss T will immediately start chasing you as soon as you unlock the cabinet, no matter how far she is from you. Pick up the cat and run out of the house before she catches you. You can find a firecracker in the shed once more, but you can find another firecracker in the kitchen. Either way, once you have it, head to the living room and swap out the candle for the firecracker. This will not be enough to fool Miss T however. On the coffee table are a couple of ribbon rolls, each a different color. Find the roll that matches the candle, in this case the blue ribbon, and use it on the firecracker to disguise it. Miss T will start heading back to her cake once the candle has been swapped so act quickly. We would not want to ruin the surprise"
